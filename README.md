# SpeedRunDeck
Recently i've gotten into Minecraft Speedrunning, but i quickly noticed that you need to press a lot of hard keybinds to make your runs efficient and fast. For example the f3+f or f3+shift+f is used to quickly increase or decrease the render distance in minecraft which is used for pearl hanging, calculating the distance to the blaze spawner or pearl hanging. And while doing this you also need to keep moving and do other task that makes it very hard to press these keybinds. This is why i am creating my Speedrun deck which you can customize to do any keyboard shortcut with one button for minecraft. This is my first time doing electronics so i hope this is a good first project
